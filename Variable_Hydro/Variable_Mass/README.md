# Variable Hydrodynamics Variable Mass

**Author:** Jeff Grasberger

**Geometry:**	Sphere

**Original Version:** 	WEC-Sim v6.1

**Description**

This application demonstrates using WEC-Sim's variable hydrodynamics feature to model a sphere with a variable mass and draft.
The sphere's mass is set-up to change instantaneously every 100 seconds, increasing the its draft. 
The existing model is simple but can be built upon to demonstrate any WEC that changes mass during a simulation.
WEC-Sim by default does not support variable mass, so this model requires a broken library link to add the General Variable Mass block.
To recreate (for future library updates): duplicate the changes within sphereVarMass/Float/Hydrodynamic Body/Structure
R2021b or later is required because the Simulink model uses the "Create Diagonal Matrix" block which was only moved to standard Simulink in R2021b.
